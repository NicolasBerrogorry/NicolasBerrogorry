Hi stranger!
I'm an autodidacticism advocate with experience on a multitude of languages and frameworks.
I've also studied a few years at two different universities. Got good grades and far progress but I dropped out to work and try my own luck on the market.
I'm currently focusing on videogame development with Unity engine at EX33D Games, an Indie studio founded by me and a few other people.
